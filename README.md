Build a table of contents for pdf books.

Pdf books are hard to read because the table of contents usually don't match up with the pdf pages.
This python script takes care of that problem by generating a local webpage on your computer, that contains links to certain pages in the PDF book.

The only hard coding you have to do is to make json files for the books.
